# Project Progress - 2025-03-16

## Project Overview
- Developing a web application for artist Khalid Albaih
- Features a QR code-based donation system with digital content delivery
- Exhibition-to-download experience: visitors scan QR code, donate via Vipps, receive digital artwork

## Implemented Features
- Next.js 15 framework with server and client components
- Static QR code generation using Vipps Merchant Redirect
- Donation page with modal form interface
- Vipps ePayment API integration with profile data consent
- Webhook handling for payment confirmations
- Authentication system for Vipps API with token management
- Debugging endpoints for authentication troubleshooting

## Current Status
- Successfully resolved Vipps API authentication issues (401 errors)
- Implemented enhanced error handling for authentication failures
- Created debugging endpoints for credential validation
- Added token refresh functionality with automatic .env file updating
- Resolved 400 Bad Request issues:
  - Added proper phone number formatting with country code
  - Implemented the required idempotency key header
  - Fixed order reference format to match Vipps requirements (alphanumeric and hyphens only)
  - Added detailed validation and error reporting with format checking
- Fixed redirect URL handling:
  - Updated API response to use correct `redirectUrl` property from Vipps ePayment API
  - Enhanced response logging for troubleshooting
  - Wrote debug file with full payment response for analysis
- Added local tunneling setup for Vipps integration testing:
  - Documented ngrok setup process for local callback handling
  - Implemented detailed logging for Vipps API responses
  - Added comprehensive error handling and debugging tools
- Updated documentation with authentication best practices, API requirements, and local development workflow

## Latest Additions
- Implemented download API endpoint:
  - Added proper validation of download IDs
  - Implemented payment status verification
  - Created secure file serving with proper headers
  - Added usage tracking for downloads
- Set up Vercel Blob storage for downloadable content:
  - Created script for uploading sample artwork
  - Implemented proper blob structure for donations and downloads
  - Added comprehensive error handling
  - Documented blob storage structure

## Pending Tasks
- Create admin dashboard for donation management
- Implement CSV export for donation records
- Configure production environment variables
- Test end-to-end payment flow with real credentials
- Enhance security with webhook signature verification
- Remove debug endpoints before production deployment

## Next Steps
1. Create admin panel for donation records and content management
2. Implement webhook signature verification for enhanced security
3. Test complete payment-to-download flow with real Vipps credentials
4. Configure proper environment variables for production
5. Remove debug endpoints before production deployment
6. Finalize production configuration

## Issue Analysis: Download Functionality

After analyzing server logs from Vercel, we identified a key issue with the download functionality. Payments initiated via Vipps were successful (reference ID: 9wa5Xv4A0dD67dIH1a7zd), but users received 404 errors when trying to access the download page. 

### Root Cause

The primary issue was that the Vipps callback endpoint, which is responsible for creating the download mapping in Vercel Blob storage, wasn't being triggered reliably after payment completion. This resulted in:

1. Payment references being created correctly during payment initiation
2. Users being redirected to the download page with their reference ID
3. The download page failing to find any matching blob entries for that ID

### Implemented Solutions

1. **Created a Recovery Tool**: `scripts/create-missing-download.js`
   - Allows manual creation of download mappings for payments that already processed
   - Creates both the download mapping and a minimal donation record
   - Outputs a download URL that can be shared with customers

2. **Enhanced Download Page Resilience**:
   - Added retry mechanism to `validateDownloadId` function
   - Implemented incremental delay between retry attempts (2 seconds)
   - Added more detailed logging to help diagnose future issues
   - Improved error handling with helpful messages for different failure scenarios

3. **Improved Vipps Callback Endpoint**:
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout the callback flow
   - Implemented data validation to ensure required fields are present
   - Added verification step to confirm blobs are properly stored
   - Introduced small delay before completion to prevent race conditions

4. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Added troubleshooting section to README.md
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with new script command
   - Added detailed comments explaining the issue and solution approach

### Next Steps for Download Functionality

1. Monitor server logs for any remaining callback failures
2. Consider implementing a webhook verification process for callbacks
3. Add alert mechanism for failed payment processing
4. Consider a backup database for critical payment and download records
